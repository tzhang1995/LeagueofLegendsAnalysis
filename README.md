# LeagueofLegendsAnalysis
Project detailing exploratory data analysis of League of Legends match data

# Run Order
1. DataExtraction
2. BasicStatisticalModels
3. ChapmionStatistics
4. TreeSVM
5. NeuralNetwork

Item's 1, 2, and 3 are in "Part 1" while the remaining items are in the folder "Part 2". This is mainly due to memory constraints - the match files are quite large and storing them in memeory is too taxing for my computer.

Note, the RDATA and match data .csv files are not uploaded to git for space reasons. You can message me if you'd like access to those files. It is not reccomended to run DataExtraction.RMD as this will take a minimum of 20 or so hours to run because of the limits on the personal API key.
